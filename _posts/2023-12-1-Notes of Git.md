# Notes of Git

## Basic Settings

```sh
git config --global user.name "kvn"
git config --global user.email username@email.com
git config --global core.autocrlf input # for MacOS
```

## Appending Operations

- Showing files in the staging area by `git ls-files`
- Storing files that are `git add` .
- Modified files will have to be `git add` again

If `git status` gives green info, it means it's all the same for **Working Directory** and **Staging Area**. If it says committed, then **Repository** too.

***Skip Staging***:

use `git commit -am "info"` for adding 

use `git rm filename1...` for deleting

use `git mv file file1` for renaming or moving

**Only do this when you know what you are doing**

## Ignoring Files

Files like logs usually shouldn't be tracked.

use .gitignore file to book files unneeded in the following form:

```code
logs/
main.log
*.log
```

If files are already in repo, adding them to .gitignore file is not going to let git ignore them. To solve this, we use `git rm --cached dir_dont_want_to_track` to only remove it from the staging area(may have to use `-r` to recursively `rm`).

## Viewing Operation

### Simple View

use `git status -s` for simplified info.

`M` for modified; `A` for added.

### See Diff

use `git diff --staged` to compare files changed between the last committed and currently staged.

use `git diff` to compare files changed between the currently staged and working directory.

### Diff Tool

**Set up**:

`git config --global diff.tool vscode`

`git config --global difftool.vscode.cmd "code --wait --diff $LOCAL $REMOTE"`

check by:

`git config --global -e`

### History

use `git log` to see history.

**Options**:

- `--oneline`: simplified output, ID & comment

- `--reverse`: presented in the way of bottom up

use `git show ID` or `git show HEAD~step_before` to see the diff of the commits

use `git show ID:file` to see the file of the commit `ID`

use `git ls-tree ID` to list all files with their `unique_id`  of version `ID`

use `git show unique_id` to see `blob` or `tree` by their `unique_id`

## Restoring Files

use `git restore --staged file` to restore files from staging area to the working directory

- when restoring modified files, git uses copies from the repo to replace files in the staging area.

- when restoring added files, git reverts the stage of files back to untracked

use `git restore file` to restore files from the working directory to the previous version

- when restoring modified files, git replaces them with the latest copies from the repo
- git doesn't restore untracked files, if no **Options** like `-fd` are given, the move is considered dangerous and will not process.

use `git restore --source=HEAD~1 file` to restore files to the version `ID`

## Remote

use `git remote add name url` to add new remote repo

use `git pull` to directly pull the repo to the working directory(space)

use `git fetch` to fetch the repo to the local repo

use `git push` to push the local repo to the remote

## Branches

### Basics

use `git branch name` to create a new branch from the current branch

use `git branch switch name` to switch HEAD to branch name

### Merge or Rebase

 The following graph presents 3 different ways of merging branches.

use `git merge feature` to merge the feature branch to the master when HEAD -> master

use `git rebase feature` to merge the branch in terms of rebase to the master

### Dealing Conflicts

when two branches change the same line of the same file and attend to merge, one has to decide which version to stay.
